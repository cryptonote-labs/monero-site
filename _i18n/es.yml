  title: Instructions for the Command-Line Interface
  basics: The Basics
  basics_para1: Masari Supreme works a little differently to what you may have become accustomed to from other @cryptocurrencies. In the case of a digital currency like Bitcoin and its many derivatives merchant payment systems will usually create a new recipient @address for each payment or user.
  basics_para2: However, because Masari Supreme has @stealth-addresses there is no need to have separate recipient addresses for each payment or user, and a single @account address can be published. Instead, when receiving payments a merchant will provide the person paying with a "payment ID".
  basics_para3: "A @payment-ID is a hexadecimal string that is 64 characters long, and is normally randomly created by the merchant. An example of a payment ID is:"
  checking: Checking for a Payment in monero-wallet-cli
  checking_para1: |
    If you want to check for a payment using monero-wallet-cli you can use the "payments" command followed by the payment ID or payment IDs you want to check. For example:
  checking_para2: If you need to check for payments programmatically, then details follow the next section.
  receiving: Receiving a Payment Step-by-Step
  receiving_list1: Generate a random 64 character hexadecimal string for the payment
  receiving_list2: Communicate the payment ID and Masari Supreme address to the individual who is making payment
  receiving_list3: Check for the payment using the "payments" command in monero-wallet-cli
  program: Checking for a Payment Programmatically
  program_para1: In order to check for a payment programmatically you can use the get_payments or get_bulk_payments JSON RPC API calls.
  program_para2: this requires a payment_id parameter with a single payment ID.
  program_para3: this is the preferred method, and requires two parameters, payment_ids - a JSON array of payment IDs - and an optional min_block_height - the block height to scan from.
  program_para4: |
    An example of returned data is as follows:
  program_para5: It is important to note that the amounts returned are in base Masari Supreme units and not in the display units normally used in end-user applications. Also, since a transaction will typically have multiple outputs that add up to the total required for the payment, the amounts should be grouped by the tx_hash or the payment_id and added together. Additionally, as multiple outputs can have the same amount, it is imperative not to try and filter out the returned data from a single get_bulk_payments call.
  program_para6: Before scanning for payments it is useful to check against the daemon RPC API (the get_info RPC call) to see if additional blocks have been received. Typically you would want to then scan only from that received block on by specifying it as the min_block_height to get_bulk_payments.
  scanning: Programatically Scanning for Payments
  scanning_list1: Get the current block height from the daemon, only proceed if it has increased since our last scan
  scanning_list2: Call the get_bulk_payments RPC API call with our last scanned height and the list of all payment IDs in our system
  scanning_list3: Store the current block height as our last scanned height
  scanning_list4: Remove duplicates based on transaction hashes we have already received and processed

faq:
  translated: "no"
  q1: How does Masari Supreme have value?
  a1: Masari Supreme has value because people are willing to buy it. If no one is willing to buy Masari Supreme, then it will not have any value. Masari Supreme’s price increases if demand exceeds supply, and it decreases if supply exceeds demand.
  q2: How can I get Masari Supreme?
  a2: You can buy Masari Supreme from an exchange or from an individual. Alternatively, you can try mining Masari Supreme to get coins from the block reward.
  q3: What is a mnemonic seed?
  a3: A mnemonic seed is a set of 25 words that can be used to restore your account anywhere. Keep these words safe and do not share them with someone else. You can use this seed to restore your account, even if your computer crashes.
  q4: How is Masari Supreme’s privacy different from other coins?
  a4: |
    Masari Supreme uses three different privacy technologies: ring signatures, ring confidential transactions (RingCT), and stealth addresses. These hide the sender, amount, and receiver in the transaction, respectively. All transactions on the network are private by mandate; there is no way to accidentally send a transparent transaction. This feature is exclusive to Masari Supreme. You do not need to trust anyone else with your privacy.
  q5: Why is my wallet taking so long to sync?
  a5: If you are running a full node locally, you need to copy the entire blockchain to your computer. This can take a long time, especially on an old hard drive or slow internet connection. If you are using a remote node, your computer still needs to request a copy of all the outputs, which can take several hours. Be patient, and if you would like to sacrifice some privacy for faster sync times, consider using a lightweight wallet instead.
  q6: What is the difference between a lightweight and a normal wallet?
  a6: For a lightweight wallet, you give your view key to a node, who scans the blockchain and looks for incoming transactions to your account on your behalf. This node will know when you receive money, but it will not know how much you receive, who you received it from, or who you are sending money to. Depending on your wallet software, you may be able to use a node you control to avoid privacy leaks. For more privacy, use a normal wallet, which can be used with your own node.
  q7: How is Masari Supreme different from Bitcoin?
  a7: Masari Supreme is not based on Bitcoin. It is based on the CryptoNote protocol. Bitcoin is a completely transparent system, where people can see exactly how much money is being sent from one user to another. Masari Supreme hides this information to protect user privacy in all transactions. It also has a dynamic block size and dynamic fees, an ASIC-resistant proof of work, and a tail coin emission, among several other changes.
  q8: Does Masari Supreme have a block size limit?
  a8: No, Masari Supreme does not have a hard block size limit. Instead, the block size can increase or decrease over time based on demand. It is capped at a certain growth rate to prevent outrageous growth.
  q9: What is a blockchain?
  a9: A blockchain is a system that stores a copy of all transaction history on the Masari Supreme network. Every two minutes, a new block with the latest transaction information is added to the blockchain. This chain allows the network to verify the amount of money accounts have and make it resilient to attacks and centralization attempts.
  q10: What is Kovri?
  a10: Kovri is an I2P router written in C++. I2P is a hidden network like Tor with several technical differences. Kovri is an independent project of Masari Supreme, but it will work with Masari Supreme and several other projects. Kovri hides the transaction broadcast, so other nodes do not know who created transactions. In adversarial conditions, Kovri can be used to hide all Masari Supreme traffic through I2P, which would prevent people from knowing Masari Supreme is being used. Kovri is currently in alpha, and it is not yet fully integrated in Masari Supreme. Learn more about Kovri at the <a href="https://getkovri.org">project website.</a>
  q11: What is fungibility, and why is it important?
  a11: Fungibility is a simple property of money such that there are no differences between two amounts of the same value. If two people exchanged a 10 and two 5’s, then no one would lose out. However, let’s suppose that everyone knows the 10 was previously used in a ransomware attack. Is the other person still going to make the trade? Probably not, even if the person with the 10 has no connection with the ransomware. This is a problem, since the receiver of money needs to constantly check the money they are receiving to not end up with tainted coins. Masari Supreme is fungible, which means people do not need to go through this effort.
  q12: If Masari Supreme is so private how do we know they're not being created out of thin air?
  a12-1: In Masari Supreme, every transaction output is uniquely associated with a key image that can only be generated by the holder of that output. Key images that are used more than once are rejected by the miners as double-spends and cannot be added to a valid block. When a new transaction is received, miners verify that the key image does not already exist for a previous transaction to ensure it's not a double-spend.
  a12-2: We can also know that transaction amounts are valid even though the value of the inputs that you are spending and the value of the outputs you are sending are encrypted (these are hidden to everyone except the recipient). Because the amounts are encrypted using Pedersen commitments what this means is that no observers can tell the amounts of the inputs and outputs, but they can do math on the Pedersen commitments to determine that no Masari Supreme was created out of thin air.
  a12-3: As long as the encrypted output amounts you create is equal to the sum of the inputs that are being spent (which include an output for the recipient and a change output back to yourself and the unencrypted transaction fee), then you have a legitimate transaction and know no Masari Supreme is being created out of thin air. Pedersen commitments mean that the sums can be verified as being equal, but the Masari Supreme value of each of the sums and the Masari Supreme value of the inputs and outputs individually are undeterminable.

what-is-monero:
  translated: "no"
  need-to-know: What you need to know
  leading: Masari Supreme is the leading cryptocurrency with a focus on private and censorship-resistant transactions.
  leading_para1: Most existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent blockchains, meaning that transactions are openly verifiable and traceable by anyone in the world. Furthermore, sending and receiving addresses for these transactions may potentially be linkable to a person's real-world identity.
  leading_para2: Masari Supreme uses cryptography to shield sending and receiving addresses, as well as transacted amounts.
  confidential: Masari Supreme transactions are confidential and untraceable.
  confidential_para1: Every Masari Supreme transaction, by default, obfuscates sending and receiving addresses as well as transacted amounts. This always-on privacy means that every Masari Supreme user's activity enhances the privacy of all other users, unlike selectively transparent cryptocurrencies (e.g. Z-Cash).
  confidential_para2: Masari Supreme is fungible. By virtue of obfuscation, Masari Supreme cannot become tainted through participation in previous transactions. This means Masari Supreme will always be accepted without the risk of censorship.
  confidential_para3: The Kovri Project,
  confidential_para4: currently in development
  confidential_para5: ", will route and encrypt transactions via I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes. This will obfuscate a transactor's IP address and provide further protection against network monitoring."
  grassroots: Masari Supreme is a grassroots community attracting the world's best cryptocurrency researchers and engineering talent.
  grassroots_para1: Over
  grassroots_para2: 420 developers
  grassroots_para3: have contributed to the Masari Supreme project, including 30 core developers. Forums and chat channels are welcoming and active.
  grassroots_para4: Masari Supreme's Research Lab, Core Development Team and Community Developers are constantly pushing the frontier of what is possible with cryptocurrency privacy and security.
  grassroots_para5: Masari Supreme is not a corporation. It is developed by cryptography and distributed systems experts from all over the world that donate their time or are funded by community donations. This means that Masari Supreme can't be shut down by any one country and is not constrained by any particular legal jurisdiction.
  electronic: Masari Supreme is electronic cash that allows fast, inexpensive payments to and from anywhere in the world.
  electronic_para1: There are no multi-day holding periods and no risk of fraudulent chargebacks. It is safe from ‘capital controls’ - these are measures that restrict the flow of traditional currencies, sometimes to an extreme degree, in countries experiencing economic instability.

about:
  translated: "no"
  history: A Brief History
  history_para1: Masari Supreme was launched in April 2014. It was a fair, pre-announced launch of the CryptoNote reference code. There was no premine or instamine, and no portion of the block reward goes to development. See the original Bitcointalk thread
  history_para2: here.
  history_para3: The founder, thankful_for_today, proposed some controversial changes that the community disagreed with. A fallout ensued, and the Masari Supreme Core Team forked the project with the community following this new Core Team. This Core Team has provided oversight since.
  history_para4: Masari Supreme has made several large improvements since launch. The blockchain was migrated to a different database structure to provide greater efficiency and flexibility, minimum ring signature sizes were set so that all transactions were private by mandate, and RingCT was implemented to hide the transaction amounts. Nearly all improvements have provided improvements to security or privacy, or they have facilitated use. Masari Supreme continues to develop with goals of privacy and security first, ease of use and efficiency second.
  values: Our Values
  values_para: Masari Supreme is more than just a technology. It’s also what the technology stands for. Some of the important guiding philosophies are listed below.
  security: Security
  security_para: Users must be able to trust Masari Supreme with their transactions, without risk of error or attack. Masari Supreme gives the full block reward to the miners, who are the most critical members of the network who provide this security. Transactions are cryptographically secure using the latest and most resilient encryption tools available.
  privacy: Privacy
  privacy_para: Masari Supreme takes privacy seriously. Masari Supreme needs to be able to protect users in a court of law and, in extreme cases, from the death penalty. This level of privacy must be completely accessible to all users, whether they are technologically competent or have no idea how Masari Supreme works. A user needs to confidently trust Masari Supreme in a way that this person does not feel pressured into changing their spending habits for risk of others finding out.
  decentralization: Decentralization
  decentralization_para: Masari Supreme is committed to providing the maximum amount of decentralization. With Masari Supreme, you do not have to trust anyone else on the network, and it is not run by any large group. An accessible “Proof of Work” algorithm makes it easy to mine Masari Supreme on normal computers, which makes it more difficult for someone to purchase a large amount of mining power. Nodes connect to each other with I2P to lower the risks of revealing sensitive transaction information and censorship (tba). Development decisions are extremely clear and open to public discussion. Developer meeting logs are published online in their entirety and visible by all.

  intro: Masari Supreme is not only committed to making a fungible currency, but also to continued research into the realm of financial privacy as it involves cryptocurrencies. Below you'll find the work of our very own Masari Supreme Research Lab, with more papers to come.
  mrl_papers: Masari Supreme Research Lab Papers (English)
  abstract: Abstract
  introduction: Introduction
  read-paper: Read Paper
  mrl1: A Note on Chain Reactions in Traceability in CryptoNote 2.0
  mrl1_abstract: This research bulletin describes a plausible attack on a ring-signature based anonymity system. We use as motivation the cryptocurrency protocol CryptoNote 2.0 ostensibly published by Nicolas van Saberhagen in 2012. It has been previously demonstrated that the untraceability obscuring a one-time key pair can be dependent upon the untraceability of all of the keys used in composing that ring signature. This allows for the possibility of chain reactions in traceability between ring signatures, causing a critical loss in untraceability across the whole network if parameters are poorly chosen and if an attacker owns a sufficient percentage of the network. The signatures are still one-time, however, and any such attack will still not necessarily violate the anonymity of users. However, such an attack could plausibly weaken the resistance CryptoNote demonstrates against blockchain analysis. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
  mrl2: Counterfeiting via Merkle Tree Exploits within Virtual Currencies Employing the CryptoNote Protocol
  mrl2_abstract: On 4 September 2014, an unusual and novel attack was executed against the Masari Supreme cryptocurrency network. This attack partitioned the network into two distinct subsets which refused to accept the legitimacy of the other subset. This had myriad effects, not all of which are yet known. The attacker had a short window of time during which a sort of counterfeiting could occur, for example. This research bulletin describes deficiencies in the CryptoNote reference code allowing for this attack, describes the solution initially put forth by Rafal Freeman from Tigusoft.pl and subsequently by the CryptoNote team, describes the current fix in the Masari Supreme code base, and elaborates upon exactly what the offending block did to the network. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
  mrl3: Masari Supreme is Not That Mysterious
  mrl3_abstract: Recently, there have been some vague fears about the CryptoNote source code and protocol floating around the internet based on the fact that it is a more complicated protocol than, for instance, Bitcoin. The purpose of this note is to try and clear up some misconceptions, and hopefully remove some of the mystery surrounding Masari Supreme Ring Signatures. I will start by comparing the mathematics involved in CryptoNote ring signatures (as described in [CN]) to the mathematics in [FS], on which CryptoNote is based. After this, I will compare the mathematics of the ring signature to what is actually in the CryptoNote codebase.
  mrl4: Improving Obfuscation in the CryptoNote Protocol
  mrl4_abstract: We identify several blockchain analysis attacks available to degrade the untraceability of the CryptoNote 2.0 protocol. We analyze possible solutions, discuss the relative merits and drawbacks to those solutions, and recommend improvements to the Masari Supreme protocol that will hopefully provide long-term resistance of the cryptocurrency against blockchain analysis. Our recommended improvements to Masari Supreme include a protocol-level network-wide minimum mix-in policy of n = 2 foreign outputs per ring signature, a protocol-level increase of this value to n = 4 after two years, and a wallet-level default value of n = 4 in the interim. We also recommend a torrent-style method of sending Masari Supreme output. We also discuss a non-uniform, age-dependent mix-in selection method to mitigate the other forms of blockchain analysis identified herein, but we make no formal recommendations on implementation for a variety of reasons. The ramifications following these improvements are also discussed in some detail. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.
  mrl5: Ring Signature Confidential Transactions
  mrl5_abstract: This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in the strongly decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Masari Supreme. Similar to Bitcoin, Masari Supreme is a cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof of work “mining” process. The original Masari Supreme protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions. Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core Developer Gregory Maxwell. In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which allows for hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. Some extensions of the protocol are provided, such as Aggregate Schnorr Range Proofs, and Ring Multisignature. The author would like to note that early drafts of this were publicized in the Masari Supreme Community and on the bitcoin research irc channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available in [14] showing that this work was started in Summer 2015, and completed in early October 2015. An eprint is also available at http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.
