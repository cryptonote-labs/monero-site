### What

Additional GUI developer.

### Who

I’m Jaquee. I have 10+ yrs experience of various kinds of coding. I’m new to the crypto world. Have only been around for a couple of months and i like what i see. I’ve been contributing to Monero for about a month now and this is what i’ve come up with so far:

[https://github.com/monero-project/monero-core/commits/master?author=Jaqueeee](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-core/commits/master?author=Jaqueeee)

[https://github.com/monero-project/monero/commits/master?author=jaqueeee](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/commits/master?author=jaqueeee)

### Why

I love the fundamentals of Monero and want to get more involved in the community. I believe an official GUI will help Monero go mainstream. Ilya has done a terrific job so far, but his time is limited and I’m happy to help out. The public beta is soon to be released but a lot of features such as daemon integration (start/stop), better remote node support, ux improvements, porting to smartphones, third party plugin system etc. are not finished yet.

### The Proposal and Milestones

Hourly pay: 4.5 xmr (~$25)

10-20 hours per week over 6 months. ~550 hours

Total: 2475 XMR

Milestones: I’ll write reports every 50 hours and will be working on the missing features and future requests from community.

Payments: 11 payments of 225 XMR, one for each 50 hour milestone (paid in XMR)

### Expiration

9 months

Edit: Changed xml.to integration in examples -> third party plugin system.
