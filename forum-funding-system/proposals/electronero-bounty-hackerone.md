### What: 
We need dedicated funds to satisfy bounty for Electronero and all Electronero sub-projects on [hackerone.com/electronero](https://hackerone.com/electronero)

### Who:
[me](https://forum.getmonero.org/9/work-in-progress/86967/anonimal-s-kovri-full-time-development-funding-thread)

### Why: 
Now that our VRP is in place and Electronero/Kovri HackerOne account launched, we need to have funds available before inviting hackers/researchers (offering ETNX/BTC as exploit bounty was agreed to long ago in #kovri-dev (and in recent meetings)).

### The Proposal and Milestones: 
No milestones, just much needed crowdfunding. As mentioned [here](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/39#issuecomment-289310019): "set a 500 ETNX minimum bounty"

### Expiration: 
N/A
